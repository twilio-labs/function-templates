Formatting with prettier failed with an error; this may be due to a syntax
error. See the above output for details. If prettier appears to be failing
for another reason, you can skip this check using the $(--no-verify) flag on
your $(git commit) command. Please consider opening an issue at
https://github.com/twilio-labs/function-templates/issues if you need to
skip this check for a reason that is not the result of a syntax error.
