      <div id="hipaa-disclaimer" style="margin-bottom: 20px;">
        Note that this app is designed for prototyping purposes only and you should<br/><a href="https://ahoy.twilio.com/vaccine-distribution-1" target="_blank">consult with a Twilio Expert</a> before publicly offering this service in a production context.
      </div>
      <p>This app is designed for public health agencies to create a COVID-19 vaccine eligibility standby list for their city or state.
      Residents send an SMS to a pre-configured phone number, and are asked a series of demographic questions informed by the CDC's vaccine rollout guidelines powered by a Twilio Studio Flow.
       
      <p>This data is meant to help ensure vaccinations are administered as quickly as possible as supply becomes available. With this template, your agency can create a standardized list of eligible
      vaccine recipients. In exchange for sharing this information, residents are instructed that they will be notified when it is their turn to receive the vaccine. <strong>Note:</strong> This template does not currently include functionality to send notifications after registration.</p>

          <h3>Troubleshooting</h3>
          <ul>
            <strong>If you aren't getting a response when texting your phone number, make sure that:</strong>
            <li>If your account is in trial mode, you are sending the SMS from <a href="https://www.twilio.com/docs/usage/tutorials/how-to-use-your-free-trial-account#verify-your-personal-phone-number" target="_blank">verified phone numbers</a>.</li>
            <li>Your Twilio phone number's (<a href="https://www.twilio.com/console/phone-numbers/incoming" target="_blank"><span class="phone-number"></span></a>) Message Configuration is set to the "Vaccine Standby Intake" Studio Workflow.</li>
          </ul>
          <ul>
            <strong>If you aren't seeing responses show up in the table above, make sure that:</strong>
            <li>The texter has fully completed the chatbot interaction. Responses are not added until the end (e.g. "You are now on the vaccine standby list").</li>
            <li>You see the execution logged <a class="execution-logs-link" href="" target="_blank">here</a> and the status of the execution is set to <code>ended</code>.</li>
