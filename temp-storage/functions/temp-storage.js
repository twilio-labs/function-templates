/**
 *
 *  This Function shows you how to reach and utilise the temporary storage under the Function layer, mainly for single-invocation jobs
 *  For example, on each invocation we can create a file based on user data and use it accordingly
 *
 *  IMPORTANT: Do NOT treat this storage as long term storage or for personal data that need to persist.
 *  The contents get deleted whenever the associated container is brought down, so this function is useful for one time actions
