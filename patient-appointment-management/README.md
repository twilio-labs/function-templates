## Pre-requisites

### Environment variables

This project requires some environment variables to be set. A file named `.env` is used to store the values for those environment variables. To keep your tokens and secrets secure, make sure to not commit the `.env` file in git. When setting up the project with `twilio serverless:init ...` the Twilio CLI will create a `.gitignore` file that excludes `.env` from the version history.

In your `.env` file, set the following values:

| Variable | Description | Required |
| :------- | :---------- | :------- |


### Function Parameters

`/save-booked|cancel|cancelled|confirm|confirmed|modified|noshowed|remind|rescheduled` is protected and requires a valid Twilio signature as well as the following parameters:

| Parameter | Description | Required |
| :-------- | :---------- | :------- |
| appointment | appointment information | Y |
