# Twilio Function Templates

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/twilio-labs/function-templates.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/twilio-labs/function-templates)

[Twilio Functions](https://www.twilio.com/functions) are a serverless environment to build and run Twilio applications so you can get to production faster. You provide the Node.js code to perform the task you need and Twilio runs it. You can read [more about Twilio Functions and how to use them in the introductory blog post](https://www.twilio.com/blog/2017/05/introducing-twilio-functions.html).

## This repo

This repo is intended to be a collection of useful Twilio Functions that are tested and documented. The intention is that you can take any of these Functions and drop them into a project, confident they will work. Whether you are a developer looking for a particular building block or a builder who justs needs a particular Function. These templates are also available through `twilio-run new` inside the [`twilio-run`](https://npm.im/twilio-run) CLI.

## Usage

Each Function lives in its own directory within this repo. To use the code, copy the contents of the main Function file to your Twilio Function. Make sure you read the Function README so that you know which environment variables to set and the parameters the Function takes when you make HTTP requests to it.
