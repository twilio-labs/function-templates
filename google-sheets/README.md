# Google Sheets

Logs incoming SMS numbers and messages into a Google Sheets spreadsheet.

## Pre-requisites

To use this function, you will need a Google Sheets spreadsheet you want to log messages into, and a Google Cloud service account and associated authentication key. See the Google documentation on [creating a service account](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/creating-managing-service-accounts#creating) and [generating an authentication key](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/creating-managing-service-account-keys#creating_service_account_keys) for details. Ensure that your authentication key is in JSON format, and that it is saved to a file named `auth.json` under the `assets` directory for this function.

### Environment variables

This project requires some environment variables to be set. To keep your tokens and secrets secure, make sure to not commit the `.env` file in git. When setting up the project with `twilio serverless:init ...` the Twilio CLI will create a `.gitignore` file that excludes `.env` from the version history.

In your `.env` file, set the following values:

| Variable          | Description                                                       | Required |
| :---------------- | :---------------------------------------------------------------- | :------- |
| SHEETS_DOC_ID     | The document ID for your Google Sheets spreadsheet                | Yes      |
| SHEETS_SHEET_NAME | The spreadsheet name to log to within your Google Sheets document | Yes      |
