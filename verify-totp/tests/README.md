# Twilio Verify Time-based One-time passwords (TOTP)

This demo of the [Twilio Verify API](https://www.twilio.com/docs/verify/api) includes the TOTP factor type for supporting authenticator apps like Authy or Google Authenticator.

**Verify TOTP is in Pilot, which means that you'll need to [contact sales to request access to the API](https://www.twilio.com/help/sales). We expect to have Verify TOTP in Public Beta (at which point the API will be availble for self service) by the end of 2021.**

## Pre-requisites

* A Verify Service. [Create one in the Twilio Console](https://www.twilio.com/console/verify/services)

### Environment variables

This project requires some environment variables to be set. To keep your tokens and secrets secure, make sure to not commit the `.env` file in git. When setting up the project with `twilio serverless:init ...` the Twilio CLI will create a `.gitignore` file that excludes `.env` from the version history.

In your `.env` file, set the following values:

| Variable             | Meaning                                                           | Required |

| `AUTH_TOKEN`         | Find in the [console](https://www.twilio.com/console)             | Yes      |
| `VERIFY_SERVICE_SID` | Create one [here](https://www.twilio.com/console/verify/services) | Yes      |
