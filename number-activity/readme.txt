Instructions

On index.html you will see various fields and buttons that you can use. 

The 1st one is to insert the password. This is important as the app will not work without a correct password. 
To change the password, you need to open your function, click on Environmental Variables and edit the Password variable.

The 2nd one is the section that shows which Main account you are working with. 
Because this is a public URL, your account SID is masked by default and you can unmask it by inserting the correct password and clicking on "Show Account" button. If the password is incorrect, the message "Wrong password" will be displayed. 

In the next section you can insert the sub account SID for which you want to check the usage for each number on the sub account.

In the following section, you can insert the phone number for which you want to check the usage. You need to insert the number that is present on the main account (if the sub-account field is empty) or a number that is present on the inserted sub-account. If the number is not present on the account, an error will be displayed.  

Select the desired timeline and use one of the 2 buttons "Check and List Activity" or "Check Activity and Download Without Listing Data".

The 1st button checks the usage per number and displays the results on the page, while the 2nd button checks the usage and directly downloads the results without displaying them.

If you list the data, you can clear the list with the "Clear list" button or download the results with "Download listed numbers" button.
